TREE is an abbreviation for “Transformation through Research, Education and Empowerment”.

TREE Foundation is a non-profit society primarily working in the fields of education, livelihoods and skill development. It has planned and implemented projects in the states of Meghalaya, Assam, Chhattisgarh, and Arunachal Pradesh. What differentiates TREE from other organizations in the region is its diverse team led by the IIM Shillong faculty-alumnus duo.

While the name indicates the mission and means of the organization, the idea behind TREE has ‘deeper roots’.

A tree in the natural world is the best example of a complex yet self-sustaining unit. Although it draws all its requirements for sustenance and growth from its surroundings, it gives back more, thereby creating a whole ecosystem around it. TREE Foundation intends to replicate this ecosystem of benevolence in the human world!

Human civilization seems to be at the crossroads seeking solutions to strike a balance between growth and sustainability; and between equity and prosperity. There is an urgent need to address the issue of imbalances in the society by empowering people using the tools of research and education, and posit mankind as a part of nature that thrives in a scenario of abundance and growth that would pave the way for meaningful and sustainable development. 

On this backdrop, TREE Foundation aspires to create a social sector organization which upholds the values of humanity and sustainability alongside professionalism; and which creates the much needed platform for the dynamic youth of this country to contribute towards societal development with the spirit of entrepreneurship.
